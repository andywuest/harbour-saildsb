# SailDSB

This repository contains the sources of the SailDSB application for Sailfish OS.

The SailDSB application is a native Sailfish OS client for DSBmobile (Android and iOS app).
The application uses the original APIs to talk to the server and provides a native UI for the data.
The application is more or less a digital blackboard for information regarding school announcements. 

So far the application does only provide the standin plans, since the school my kid visits only provides
these information. More could be implemented, but is not planned, as long as the school does not use
more features and provides more information.
